ABOUT US

With the team's effort in dealing with this task, we pride ourselves and on our product.
With the leading of the 7th contributor, we passed through obstacles on our way including the limitation of specialised knowledge.

The 3rd and 4th contributors whose experiences designing and implementing websites assisted our team in doing the framework, layout, ... and fixing bugs.

Among members, some of them used the existing template and others designed their own ideas. By the way, they tried their best in this duty with impressive success.
