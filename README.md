# Trainee Program

This is our, team 3, website project.

+The website was designed by Thai Tuan. The effect he used is Scrolling Parallax. This is how he have done it:
- Firstly, for the background, he searched the vector image on Internet, then put it in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to process it into separated layers. Also he used the logo from Trainee Program.
- Secondly, to make the website work, he wrote the whole necessary HTML/CSS for the website, then wrote a JavaScript to make it more interactive (Scrolling Parallax effect) (detailed files are put in our repository (master branch)).
- The next step, there were many bugs and he had to check them.
- Finally, he published them onto "Trainee-Program" repository.

+After discussing about the project and reviewing Tuan's website in a MSTeam meeting:
- Tuan and Huynh Tien decided to optimize the website many times.
- Each member designed his/her own personal information card or use the template from Trainee Program, then pushed the card (.html format) onto repository.
- Tien adjusted the website to perfectly fit 11 personal cards, adding some more effects to it by using HTML/CSS/JS, then pulled and added 11 card into the website. (we're using <iframe> to import personal card for convenient mean).
- Then, we gave the website a final touch with more changes.
- Finally, we published the code onto Trainee-Program repository and deployed it on github.io.

The website is now done (final product is in index.html)
